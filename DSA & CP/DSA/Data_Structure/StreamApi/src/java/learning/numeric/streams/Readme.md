# Numeric Streams

Numeric Streams in Java are specialized streams that deal with primitive numeric data type instead of Objects.

They provided additional functionality and performance benefits as compared to regular streams when working with numeric data.

Java 8 introduced the **IntStream**, **LongStream** and **DoubleStream** interfaces as specialized numeric stream types.


## 1. IntStream
    
It represents a stream of integer values. It provides methods for generating integer ranges, performing numeric operations, and working with primitive integer values.

## 2. LongStream

It represents a stream of long values. It provides methods for generating long ranges, performing numeric operations, and working with primitive long values.

## 1. DoubleStream

It represents a stream of double values. It provides methods for generating double ranges, performing numeric operations, and working with primitive double values.
